Linux security is divided in many partrs, some of them are

1. **`Access Controls`**: Access control methods make use of **user and password-based authentication** to determine who can access the systems

2. **`PAM`**: Stands for **Pluggable Authentication Model** and it is another way of managing authentication in Linux. It is normally used to **authenticate users to programs and services** in Linux.

3. **`Network Security`**: Restrict or allow access to **services listening** on the Linux server. While we commonly rely on external firewalls to do this,
it can also be set up within the Linux system by making use of tools such as **IPTables** and **Firewalld**
4. **`SSH Hardening`**: SSH stands for Secure Shell
and it is used for **remote access to a server over an unsecured network**. 
5. **`SELinux`**: SELinux makes use of **security policies for isolating applications** running on the same system from each other
to protect the Linux server
